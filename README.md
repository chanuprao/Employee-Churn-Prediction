# Algorithm

Logistic Regression was used for this classification model

# Summary

An accuracy of 79% was acheived in predicting the employee churn and a few insights for the HR team were generated too.
Based on the AUC metric, it looks like there can be several other machine learning techniques that can be explored to get better results.
